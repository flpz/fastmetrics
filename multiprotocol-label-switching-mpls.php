						<h3>What Is MPLS?</h3>
						<p>MPLS is an acronym for Multi Protocol Label Switching. MPLS is a type of protocol that is used to shape network traffic flows and to increase speed and improve network performance.</p>
						<p>There are various opinions in the <a href="https://www.fastmetrics.com/blog/tech/sd-wan-vs-mpls/">SD-WAN vs MPLS</a> debate. Click the link to learn why we still utilize MPLS over SD-WAN network solutions, at this time.</p>
						<p>It was created in the 1990s, to help speed up the flow of data. Switches were used to prevent routers from losing time. Back then, routers needed to stop and look up routing tables to send information across networks.</p>
						<p>It has evolved since. Fastmetrics Network Engineers can provide economical, yet advanced MPLS techniques, over your existing network infrastructure.</p>

				<h3 class="text-center">Switching Creates Better Networks</h3>
				<p>As a standard today, networks are divided into numerous segments through switches. Each segment can have individual data communications, which results in load separation. This allows for multiple message frames to be in transit simultaneously. This parallel data flow is responsible for a network performance boost and efficient communications.</p>
				<p>With Fastmetrics managed network solutions, our dedicated Network Engineers can determine which label-switched paths (LSPs), should be used to create the right traffic patterns for a network. Layer 3 VPNs, Layer 2 VPNs, IPV6, GMPLS, and other MPLS application components can be integrated to enhance security, efficiency, and scalability.</p>
				<p>With Multiprotocol Label Switching, Fastmetrics is able to build intelligent networks that come with advanced, next generation services, all within a single architecture. Depending on what infrastructure a business is currently working with, and what the goals are for their end-to-end network communications, our engineers and security experts can leverage an existing system with value-added features or migrate to MPLS.</p>
