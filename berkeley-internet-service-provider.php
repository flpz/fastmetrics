				<p><em itemprop="reviewBody">We've been using Fastmetrics at work for about 4 years. We needed a VOIP and Internet provider and we wanted Fiber instead of DSL so that we could get more bandwidth and better latency. The service is great, both the VOIP and Internet work really well (much better than our previous provider). They helped us get setup, select equipment, and helped through a seamless office move as well. Their support is also very responsive and proactive (vs reactive).</em></p>

				<h3 class="text-center">The latest business ISP solutions</h3> 
				<p>Internet services have evolved. No longer do businesses have to settle for second rate copper based service. Businesses that upgrade to fiber optic internet service are reaping clear benefits. Fiber internet is more reliable than <a href="https://www.fastmetrics.com/managed-business-wifi-service.php">WiFi</a> and copper connectivity. Managed metricFIBER from Fastmetrics also allows faster access to the cloud with <a href="https://www.fastmetrics.com/how-fast-is-fiber-optic-internet.php">high speed uploads and downloads</a>.</p>
				<p>Business phone services have also improved. Hosted phone service from Fastmetrics allows a level of features and flexibility not seen from older phone systems. Free unlimited calls across the USA and cheaper long distance rates. Setup, support and added features included in a flat monthly service fee from $20.</p>
