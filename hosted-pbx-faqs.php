								<p>PBX is the abbreviation of <strong>P</strong>rivate <strong>B</strong>ranch <strong>E</strong>xchange. A PBX is a phone system that is used within a business or organization to make internal calls (employee to employee) as well as external calls (employee to outside callers).</p>
								<p>A Private Branch Exchange phone service typically includes voice mail, call transfers and auto attendants, which replaced telephone switch attendants or operators. A PBX provided a much more efficient way to make call connections and handle increased call volume.</p>
								<p>Today, PBX services are commonplace over traditional phone lines. The latest and most advanced version of a PBX utilizes the Internet.</p>
								<p>Hosted, IP or cloud-based PBX services have become more efficient and increasingly popular for businesses to manage phone calls.</p>
								<p>Before we get into frequently asked questions about hosted PBX systems, let’s answer two up front about standard PBXs.</p>

								<span itemprop="text">
									<p>A traditional PBX setup consists of on premise hardware, such as cabinets. A PBX enables individuals within an organization to make internal and external phone calls.</p>
									<p>To make external calls, a PBX provides phone lines that connect employees with the Public Switch Telephony Network (PSTN).</p>
									<p>Today, many organizations opt for cloud based or <strong>hosted PBX</strong> services. These require an <a href="https://www.fastmetrics.com/fiber-optic-internet.php">Internet connection with adequate bandwidth</a> or <a href="https://www.fastmetrics.com/multiprotocol-label-switching-mpls.php">MPLS to prioritize voice traffic</a>, when required.</p>
									<p>The basic function of a hosted PBX is the same as a traditional on-premise PBX. A major difference is an external phone or voice service provider will “host” and manage the PBX for end users. Hosted PBXs or cloud PBX systems are commonly hosted in data centers.</p>
									<p>Instead of routing calls through on-premise hardware, voice data is sent using the Internet to the hosted PBX.</p>

								<p>A hosted Private Branch Exchange (PBX), also commonly known as a cloud-based PBX, is a private telephone service that enables organizations to make internal and external calls and connections via the Internet.</p>
								<p>A hosted PBX offers access to a variety of different <a href=""https://www.fastmetrics.com/cloud-phone-service-features.php">calling and communication features</a>. Some of these features may include;</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Call routing</li>
									<li>Auto attendants</li>
									<li>Call forwarding and parking</li>
									<li>Call to e-mail or text transcriptions</li>
									<li>Call groups and conference calling</li>

									<li>Hunt groups</li>
									<li>Softphones</li>
									<li>Mobile app integrations</li>
									<li>Presence</li>
									<li>….and many more</li>
								</ul>
								<p>The aim of modern features associated with a cloud or hosted PBX, is to create a streamlined and efficient phone service. This applies to users both internal and external users of the phone system.</p>
								<p>A hosted PBX is managed and maintained by a voice or Internet Service Provider. This means there is no requirement for costly equipment installation. Maintenance and management of this type of phone system is all taken care of by the offsite service provider who hosts the PBX.</p>

								<span itemprop="text">
								<p>Like a traditional PBX, a hosted PBX connects callers and phone numbers internally and externally for an organization. Instead of these connections occurring over traditional phone lines, they are made via the Internet and <a href="https://www.fastmetrics.com/yealink-phone-features.php">IP based phones</a> with a hosted system.</p>
								<p>A cloud or hosted PBX eliminates the need for expensive and bulky on-site hardware. Management, servicing, maintenance and updates are included by the service provider, which ‘hosts’ the PBX system offsite.</p>
								<p>Unlike traditional on-premise PBX services, a hosted phone system allows users to accept and make calls from a variety of devices.</p>
								<p>If a user’s device is connected to the internet and has the required application or software, a user can ‘mimic’ or maintain their office phone system presence from anywhere.</p>

								<p>The major differences between a hosted PBX and a traditional PBX phone service are;</p>
								<ul>
									<li>A hosted PBX operates utilizing Internet service.</li>
									<li>There are no onsite hardware requirements for a hosted PBX.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Due to the above, a hosted system can provide significant cost savings.</p>
								<p>Reductions in phone service costs with a hosted or cloud PBX are due to a variety of factors including;</p>
								<ul>
									<li>No large initial costs to purchase physical PBX equipment.</li>
									<li>Elimination of need for on-site PBX installation.</li>
									<li>Less space requirements (room to house physical hardware).</li>
									<li>No specialist management or on-site technicians for PBX maintenance.</li>
									<li>Often free calls due to the use of the Internet to make connections.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><strong>A hosted or cloud PBX does require compatible handsets such as IP phones or devices, such as soft phones or mobile apps. These are required to make calls using this Internet based service.</strong></p>
								<p>As a hosted PBX operates over the internet, management of the phone service is more efficient. Tasks such as scaling the service to add new users is simple. This makes a hosted PBX ideal for businesses or organizations who anticipate growth or large seasonable fluctuations in phone users.</p>

								<p>Call routing systems, also known as Automatic Call Distributors (ACD), allow businesses to route traffic based on a variety of different qualifiers. These qualifiers can include;</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Time of day</li>
									<li>Current call volume</li>
									<li>Requested department</li>
									<li>Preferred language of the caller</li>
								</ul>
								<p>When utilizing call routing through a hosted PBX, businesses can take control and channel calls. Variables like employee departments, business hours and network strain during hours of high call volume can be factored in.</p>
