		<h3>1. $0 Install Costs</h3>
		<p>$0 is how much a <a href="https://www.fastmetrics.com/cloud-based-pbx-service.php">cloud phone system costs</a> to install. We can't say the same for a standard PBX.</p> 
	</div>

		<p>No more PBX cabinets taking up space.</p> 
	</div>
	<div class="content-bloc">
		<h3>4. Redundancy</h3>
		<p>Multiple servers can be employed for cloud phones. No more relying on a single piece of equipment.</p> 
	</div>
	<div class="content-bloc">
		<h3>5. Presence</h3>
		<p>Easily set up and manage virtual offices across town, interstate or worldwide.</p> 
	</div>
	<div class="content-bloc">
		<h3>6. Faster Install</h3>
		<p>Much faster than a standard PBX, as no physical PBX equipment is needed.</p> 
	</div>
	<div class="content-bloc">
		<h3>7. Flexibility</h3>
		<p>Add new users with call control instantly. Use your existing phone hardware.</p> 
	</div>
	<div class="content-bloc">
		<h3>8. Energy Saver</h3>
		<p>Overall, cloud PBXs use less equipment = less energy and a lower power bill.</p> 
	</div>
	<div class="content-bloc">
		<h3>9. Reduced Carbon Footprint</h3>
		<p>Using less energy is good for the environment.</p>
