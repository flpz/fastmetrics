				<p>Is your business still relying on copper based internet service to support the demands of today's users? Video, cloud services, VoIP, streaming, CRMs...all require greater bandwidth and faster speeds.</p>
				<p>We have upgraded thousands of businesses from copper based service to <a href="https://www.fastmetrics.com/fiber-optic-internet.php" class="white">fiber optic internet</a>. The benefits are clear. Fiber internet is more reliable. Our symmetric fiber connects and <a href="https://www.fastmetrics.com/how-fast-is-fiber-optic-internet.php" class="white">uploads and downloads faster</a>.</p>
				<p>Business phone services have also adapted. Choose from a range of handset options and increased redundancy. No longer does your business phone system have to be a cabinet hidden away in a back room, which only certain techs know how to maintain. Free unlimited calls across America and cheaper long distance with a managed phone system over our private voice network. We offer our <a href="9-cloud-phone-system-benefits.php" class="white">cloud PBX solution</a> to Sunnyvale businesses, in addition to our <a href="hostedbusinessvoip.php" class="white">hosted business VoIP</a> and SIP trunks.</p>
