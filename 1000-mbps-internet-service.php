				<h3 class="text-center">Powerful Gigabit Fiber Internet Connectivity</h3>
				<p>Connect tellingly to the Internet. 1000Mbps (1 Gigabit per second), is the equivalent of 660 x T1s. That's the download speed. Add upload speed and you're receiving service the speed of 1100 x T1s combined. To achieve 1Gbps speeds via <a href="https://www.t1shopper.com/service/t1/t1-line.shtml" target="_blank">bonding T1s is just not cost effective</a>.</p>
				<p>Fiber internet wins over copper. It is more reliable and speeds up your network services. It's less patchy than <a href="https://www.fastmetrics.com/managed-business-wifi-service.php">WiFi</a> - no more 'dead spots'. If you need to transfer data fast, fiber internet service provides the lowest latency. Streamline your business network services such as voice, hosting, cloud storage and more. Converge services over a single, reliable fiber internet connection.</p>
				<p><em>* Free fiber internet install: Fiber construction shall not exceed contract value.</em><br><em>** Free IPs: Up to 5 free IP addresses provided.</em></p>

				<h3>6 things you should know about our Gigabit Internet service</h3>
				<h4>1. The fastest Internet available.</h4> 
				<p>Not only the fastest Internet service, but also the most reliable Internet in the Bay Area. We provide a Service Level Agreement which guarantees uptime. The dominating difference between Gigabit <a href="https://www.fastmetrics.com/blog/tech/dsl-vs-cable-vs-fiber/" title="How fast is Fiber Optic Internet?">fiber vs. cable vs. broadband speeds</a> is highlighted in download times. Instantly stream or download songs, videos, TV shows, movies and more.</p>
				<p><strong>Quick comparison;</strong> 1Gbps downloads a 2 hour HD movie in approx. 25 seconds. This takes about 32 minutes with 20Mbps broadband. For businesses, 1Gbps fiber translates to a high speed Internet service which assists faster cloud access, VoIP phone systems, data center connectivity and more, for multiple employees.</p>
				<div class="divider20"></div>
				<h4>2. Fiber optic delivery.</h4> 
				<p>We deliver 1000Mbps symmetric over fiber. <a href="https://www.fastmetrics.com/blog/tech/fiber-optic-cables-how-they-work/">Fiber optic cable</a> is the fastest technology available to send data and voice traffic. Fiber technology ensures the lowest latency. Packets are delivered faster and more efficiently than ever.</p>
				<div class="divider20"></div>
				<h4>3. Free installation & hardware.</h4> 
				<p>Completely free delivery and installation of fiber to qualified Bay Area locations. Cisco hardware is included and we manage your install from the fiber pull through to delivering our 1000 Mbps service.</p>
				<div class="divider20"></div>
				<h4>4. No data caps.</h4> 
				<p>No data caps on downloading or uploading. No fine print or extra charges for exceeding data usage.</p>
				<div class="divider20"></div>
				<h4>5. Maximum value.</h4> 
				<p>Not only fast and reliable, a Gigabit connection from Fastmetrics provides value for money. The cost of combining more than 1100 T1 lines is not only too costly, but is delivered over copper which is not as efficient or reliable.</p>
				<div class="divider20"></div>
				<h4>6. Superior customer service.</h4> 
				<p>We provide dedicated business Internet and phone services to the <a href="http://www.fastmetrics.com/internet-service-area.php" title="entire Bay Area">entire Bay Area</a>, and have been since 1994. You can speak to our <a href="http://www.fastmetrics.com/techsupport.php" title="local Support Team">local Support Team</a> directly. Not that you'll need to worry about downtime with our fiber!</p>
