				<h3>Local Internet &amp; Phone Services Oakland</h3>
				<p>We've been serving the Oakland area with the highest speed Internet services available, since 1994. Twenty years of high quality Internet and phone services for small, medium and large Oakland based companies. We have proudly supported and supplied fiber optic Internet, hosted phones and data center services to West Oakland's very own PsPrint, since 2004. To this day, we are pleased to maintain our partnership with PsPrint. Our level of dedication has been welcomed as more than an ISP, but an extension of their IT department.</p>
