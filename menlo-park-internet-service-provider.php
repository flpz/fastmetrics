		<h3>The latest business ISP solutions</h3>

In addition to fiber internet being more reliable than WiFi and copper connections, fiber also <a href="how-fast-is-fiber-optic-internet.php">uploads and downloads media and files faster</a>.</p>
		<p>Business phone services have also improved. There are better options available than a phone cabinet hidden away in a back room, which only certain techs know how to maintain.</p> 
		<p>The emergence of the cloud has enabled more efficient and flexible telecommunications. Get free unlimited calls across America and cheaper long distance with a managed phone system over our private voice network. We offer our <a href="9-cloud-phone-system-benefits.php">cloud PBX solution</a> to Menlo Park businesses, in addition to <a href="hostedbusinessvoip.php">hosted business VoIP</a> and SIP trunks.</p>
